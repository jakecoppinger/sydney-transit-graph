    <p>
      A visualisation of realtime Sydney bus congestion. 

      Each line on the graph (a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Mareys-graphical-train-schedule-Used-from-Tufte-2001-Original-source-E-J_fig3_340933385">
      Marey chart</a>) represents a bus completing its route (percentage) over time. Click on
      a line to highlight the position of that particular bus on the map.
    
      When the angle of the line is shallow, there is bus congestion. When the lines are bunched together,
      there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_bunching">bus bunching</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Less bus congestion results in faster trip times, which in turn reduces labour costs,
      decreases bus headways (or reduces need for new buses) and improves passenger throughput.
    </p>

    <p>
      If I have time I'm interested in:
      <ul>
        <li>Correlating congestion hotspots with OpenStreetMap lane data to better inform bus lane
          implementation policy</li>
        <li>Writing up analysis of pre/post COVID-19 transit patterns</li>
        <li>Including train data in the pipeline (it's the same API)</li>
        <li>Improve interpolation of routes on the frontend so it's not just a straight line average
           between dots (interpolating along the route instead)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Behind the scenes</h3>
    <p>The web app is built with vanilla JS (TypeScript), <a href="https://p5js.org">p5.js</a> for the
      graph, and <a href="https://www.mapbox.com">Mapbox GL JS</a> for the map (which uses
      OpenStreetMap data).</p>
      <p>
      Data is sourced from Transport for NSW via 
      <a href="https://opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au/dataset/public-transport-realtime-vehicle-positions">OpenData</a>.
    Realtime data is ingested every few seconds via an service running on AWS EC2 to store
    Protocol Buffer files on AWS S3.
    </p>

    <p>
      When requested via an API, a service on AWS Lambda retrives these Protocol Buffer files and
      computes the trip progress and occupancy of every bus in a specified time window.
      </p>

      <p>
      I adjustably quantise the number of Protocol Buffers requested
      (and thus the number of results) via looking up available timestamps.
      </p>
      <p>
      Trip progress is calculated by comparing positions against bus route shapes. These route shapes
      have been precomputed from GTFS database dumps (via Sqlite) and stored on AWS S3 as JSON.
